# TV Tracker â€“ How to Put It Online (Cloud Hosting)

This guide explains **in simple terms** how to put your TV tracker on the internet so you can access it from anywhere â€“ your phone, work computer, or a friend's house.

## What is Cloud Hosting?

**Cloud hosting** means putting your TV tracker on someone else's computer (called a "server") that's connected to the internet 24/7. Instead of running it on your own computer, it runs "in the cloud" and you access it through a web address.

**Why would you want this?**
- Access your TV tracker from anywhere with internet
- Don't need to leave your computer running all the time
- Can share it with family members (if you want)
- No need to install anything on your computer

**The best part:** These hosting companies do all the technical work for you! You just click a button and they automatically set everything up.

## Which Hosting Service Should You Choose?

Here are your options, from easiest to most advanced:

| Service | Cost | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Railway** | Free (with limits) | First-time users, beginners |
| **Render** | Free (with limits) | People who want reliability |
| **Heroku** | ~$7/month | People who don't mind paying for premium service |

**Recommendation:** Start with Railway â€“ it's the easiest and free!

## Setting Up Password Protection (Important!)

**Why you need this:** Once your TV tracker is online, anyone who knows the web address could potentially access it. Adding a username and password keeps it private.

**For all services above:**
1. Look for "Environment Variables" or "Config Variables"
2. Add these two variables:
   - `AUTH_USERNAME` = any username you want (like "john" or "mytracker")
   - `AUTH_PASSWORD` = a strong password (at least 12 characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols)

**Write these down!** You'll need them every time you want to access your TV tracker.

## After Your TV Tracker is Online

### Accessing Your TV Tracker:
1. Go to the web address your hosting service gave you
2. Enter the username and password you set up
3. Start tracking your shows!

- Everyone can use the same account
- All your show data will be shared between users

### Managing Your Account:
- You can log into Railway/Render/Heroku anytime to check usage
- You can change your password or other settings
- Most services will email you if there are any issues
